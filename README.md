# NotDeafBeef - 100% Assembly Audio Synthesis Engine

A real-time audio synthesis engine with **100% assembly implementation** of the entire audio pipeline, plus complete visual system for audio-reactive graphics.

## 🎯 Achievement: 100% Assembly Audio Pipeline

This project successfully implements a complete audio synthesis system entirely in ARM64 assembly:

- **Generator** (ASM) - Main audio generation engine
- **FM Voice** (ASM) - Frequency modulation synthesis 
- **Drum Voices** (ASM) - Kick, snare, hi-hat synthesis
- **Melody Voice** (ASM) - Melodic line generation
- **Limiter** (ASM) - Audio dynamics processing
- **Delay** (ASM) - Time-based audio effects
- **Oscillators** (ASM) - Sine waves, noise, wave shaping
- **Math Functions** (ASM) - SIMD sine, exponential functions

All critical audio processing runs in hand-optimized ARM64 assembly with NEON vectorization.

## 🛠 Build Requirements

**macOS (ARM64)**
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- clang compiler with ARM64 support

**Tested Configuration:**
- macOS 15.5 on Apple Silicon (arm64)
- clang version 15.0.0+

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Audio Engine (100% Assembly)

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
cd src/c

# Build 100% assembly version
make segment USE_ASM=1 VOICE_ASM="GENERATOR_ASM KICK_ASM SNARE_ASM HAT_ASM MELODY_ASM FM_VOICE_ASM LIMITER_ASM DELAY_ASM"

# Run audio generation
./bin/segment
```

This generates `seed_0xcafebabe.wav` - a complete musical composition synthesized entirely in assembly.

### 🧪 Voice Testing & Debugging Tools

**Individual Voice Testing:**
```bash
# Test individual voices in isolation
make gen_kick_single && ./bin/gen_kick_single      # → kick_single.wav
make gen_hat_single && ./bin/gen_hat_single        # → hat_single.wav  
make gen_snare_single && ./bin/gen_snare_single    # → snare_single.wav

# Flexible voice combinations
make gen_custom && ./bin/gen_custom melody         # → custom_test.wav (melody only)
./bin/gen_custom drums                             # → custom_test.wav (kick+snare+hat)
./bin/gen_custom kick snare                        # → custom_test.wav (kick+snare)
```

**Full Arrangement Testing:**
```bash
# Test complete musical arrangement with selective voice categories
make segment_test && ./bin/segment_test drums                    # Real song, drums only
./bin/segment_test drums delay                                  # Real song, drums + delay
./bin/segment_test drums melody delay                           # Real song, drums + melody + delay
./bin/segment_test drums melody delay fm limiter                # Full arrangement
```

### Alternative: C Reference Version

```bash
# Build C version (for comparison/reference)
make clean
make src/euclid.o  # Important: build this dependency first
make segment USE_ASM=0

# Manual link if needed
clang -o bin/segment src/*.o -I include
```

## ⚙️ Build Configurations

### Assembly Components Available:
- `GENERATOR_ASM` - Core audio generation
- `FM_VOICE_ASM` - FM synthesis voice
- `KICK_ASM` - Kick drum synthesis  
- `SNARE_ASM` - Snare drum synthesis
- `HAT_ASM` - Hi-hat synthesis
- `MELODY_ASM` - Melody line generation
- `LIMITER_ASM` - Audio limiting/compression
- `DELAY_ASM` - Delay/echo effects

### Example Partial Assembly Builds:

```bash
# 90% Assembly (without delay)
make segment USE_ASM=1 VOICE_ASM="GENERATOR_ASM KICK_ASM SNARE_ASM HAT_ASM MELODY_ASM FM_VOICE_ASM LIMITER_ASM"

# Just generator + drums
make segment USE_ASM=1 VOICE_ASM="GENERATOR_ASM KICK_ASM SNARE_ASM HAT_ASM"

# C reference version
make segment USE_ASM=0
```

## 🧪 Debugging Individual Voice Issues

### Component-by-Component Testing Strategy

**Step 1: Test Drums Individually**
```bash
./bin/gen_custom kick     # Should produce single kick hit
./bin/gen_custom snare    # Should produce single snare hit  
./bin/gen_custom hat      # Should produce single hi-hat hit
```

**Step 2: Test Voice Combinations**
```bash
./bin/gen_custom drums           # All drums together
./bin/gen_custom drums melody    # Drums + melodic content
./bin/gen_custom fm              # Just FM synthesis voices
```

**Step 3: Test Full Arrangement Subsets**
```bash
./bin/segment_test drums                    # Real song timing, drums only
./bin/segment_test drums melody             # Add melody to drums
./bin/segment_test drums melody delay       # Add delay effects
./bin/segment_test drums melody delay fm    # Add FM synthesis
```

### Current Voice Status (as of debugging session)
- ✅ **Kick ASM**: Working (fixed amplitude issue)
- ✅ **Snare ASM**: Working  
- ✅ **Hat ASM**: Working
- ❌ **Melody ASM**: Silent (needs debugging)
- ❓ **FM Voice ASM**: Unknown (suspected level/timing issues)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Voice-Specific Issues:

**1. Silent voice output**
```bash
# Test individual voice in isolation first
./bin/gen_custom <voice_name>
# If silent, check ASM implementation for:
# - Register preservation (x19-x28 callee-saved)
# - Struct offset correctness
# - Amplitude levels
```

**2. Voice too quiet in mix**
```bash
# Test voice alone vs. in combination
./bin/gen_custom kick              # Individual test
./bin/gen_custom drums             # In combination
# Adjust amplitude constants in ASM files if needed
```

**3. FM Voice issues**
```bash
# Test FM voices separately from drums
./bin/gen_custom fm                # FM only
./bin/segment_test fm              # FM with real timing
# Check for level issues or timing conflicts
```

### Build Issues:

**1. Undefined symbol `_euclid_pattern`**
```bash
# Solution: Build euclid dependency first
make src/euclid.o
# Then retry main build
```

**2. Segmentation fault on assembly build**
- Verify ARM64 architecture: `uname -m` should show `arm64`
- Try incremental assembly build (add one ASM component at a time)
- Check for register aliasing issues in assembly code

**3. Clang not found**
```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

**4. Build artifacts not cleaned**
```bash
make clean
# Remove any .o files manually if needed
find . -name "*.o" -delete
```

## 🎵 Audio Output

The engine generates complete musical compositions with:
- **Euclidean rhythm patterns** for drums
- **FM synthesis** for harmonic content  
- **Procedural melodies** with voice leading
- **Dynamic limiting** for clean output
- **Delay effects** for spatial depth

**Typical output:** `seed_0xcafebabe.wav` (1.6MB, 44.1kHz, ~9 seconds)
