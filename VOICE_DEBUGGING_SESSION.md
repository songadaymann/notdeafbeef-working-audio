# Voice Debugging Session - July 2025

## Context & Goals

After 35 rounds of complex debugging documented in `slice_6_generator_debugging.md`, we achieved a working all-ASM audio engine. However, the user reported audio quality issues:

- **Previous build** (without FM_VOICE_ASM): hat, snare, melody + delay work, but **no kick**
- **Full ASM build** (with FM_VOICE_ASM): only drums audible, FM delay tails but no original FM hits

**Goal**: Debug individual voice implementations to identify which ASM voices have bugs vs. mixing/level issues.

## Nuclear Refactor Implementation

### Problem: Silent C Fallbacks
The debugging log revealed "The Great C Fallback Deception" - the build system was linking both ASM and C implementations simultaneously, with C versions being called instead of ASM versions due to symbol resolution order.

### Solution: Remove All C Voice Processing
**Step 1**: Added `NO_C_VOICES` flag system
```c
// generator.h
#define NO_C_VOICES 1
```

**Step 2**: Moved C voice implementations to safety
```bash
mv src/c/src/kick.c attic/kick_full.c
mv src/c/src/snare.c attic/snare_full.c  
mv src/c/src/hat.c attic/hat_full.c
mv src/c/src/melody.c attic/melody_full.c
```

**Step 3**: Created minimal C stubs with only init/trigger functions
```c
// New src/c/src/kick.c - example
void kick_init(kick_t *k, float32_t sr) { /* init code */ }
void kick_trigger(kick_t *k) { /* trigger code */ }
/* NO kick_process - ASM implementation required */
```

**Step 4**: Fixed Makefile duplicate symbol issues
```makefile
# Exclude src/osc.o when ASM oscillators present
ifeq ($(USE_ASM),1)
GEN_OBJ := $(ASM_OBJ) $(NEON_OBJ) src/fm_presets.o src/event_queue.o src/simple_voice.o
else
GEN_OBJ := $(ASM_OBJ) src/osc.o $(NEON_OBJ) src/fm_presets.o src/event_queue.o src/simple_voice.o  
endif
```

### Result: Clean All-ASM Build
‚úÖ **No more duplicate symbols**  
‚úÖ **No silent fallbacks possible**  
‚úÖ **All-ASM build compiles and runs**

```bash
# Full ASM configuration
make segment USE_ASM=1 VOICE_ASM="GENERATOR_ASM KICK_ASM SNARE_ASM HAT_ASM MELODY_ASM LIMITER_ASM DELAY_ASM FM_VOICE_ASM"
```

## Individual Voice Testing System

### Problem: Cannot Debug Individual Components  
The `segment` program generates a full musical arrangement with all voices mixed together, making it impossible to isolate which voice has issues.

### Solution: Individual Voice Test Programs

**Single Voice Tests**:
```c
// gen_kick_single.c, gen_hat_single.c, gen_snare_single.c
int main(void) {
    kick_t kick; 
    kick_init(&kick, 44100);
    kick_trigger(&kick);           // Trigger once
    kick_process(&kick, L, R, total_frames);  // Process entire buffer
    write_wav("kick_single.wav", ...);
}
```

**Flexible Combination Tests**:
```c
// gen_custom.c  
./bin/gen_custom kick              # Just kick
./bin/gen_custom drums             # kick + snare + hat  
./bin/gen_custom kick snare        # kick + snare only
./bin/gen_custom melody            # Just melody
```

## Voice-by-Voice Debug Results

### ‚úÖ Kick ASM: WORKING (Level Issue Fixed)
**Initial Symptom**: No audible kick in full mix (RMS = 0.088)  
**Debug Process**:
1. Individual test showed kick triggers firing but seemed silent
2. Added debug output: `KICK_TRIGGER: len=22050 env_coef=0.999687 y_prev2=-0.014247 k1=1.999797`
3. Increased amplitude in ASM from 0.8 ‚Üí 1.2
4. **Result**: RMS jumped to 0.183 - kick now clearly audible

**Root Cause**: Assembly implementation was correct, but amplitude too low relative to other instruments.

### ‚úÖ Hat ASM: WORKING
**Test**: `./bin/gen_hat_single`  
**Result**: Sounds good, no issues detected

### ‚úÖ Snare ASM: WORKING  
**Test**: `./bin/gen_snare_single`
**Result**: Sounds good, no issues detected

### ‚úÖ Melody ASM: FIXED (Register Corruption Bug)
**Initial Problem**: Completely silent with position counter corruption (pos became 1086918620)  
**Debug Process**:
1. Individual test showed melody triggers firing correctly
2. Only first sample generated: `L[0] = -0.234000` then silence
3. **Root Cause**: Complex libm `_expf` call with register preservation was corrupting position counter
4. **Solution**: Replaced with simplified ASM using polynomial decay approximation
5. **Result**: Now generates `5000/5000` samples correctly with smooth waveform progression

**Current Status**: Melody ASM works correctly - generates musical sawtooth with proper envelope decay.

### ‚úÖ FM Voice ASM: COMPLETED (Full FM Synthesis Implementation)
**Discovery**: FM system has **TWO separate voices** - `mid_fm` and `bass_fm`
- **Bass FM**: Lower freq (~69Hz), longer duration (1.1s), higher amplitude (0.35)
- **Mid FM**: Higher freq (~494Hz), shorter duration (0.14s), lower amplitude (0.25)

**Implementation Journey**:
1. **Phase 1**: Replaced non-functional stub with basic sawtooth approximation - worked but sounded harsh
2. **Phase 2**: Implemented proper FM synthesis `sin(carrier + index * sin(modulator))` with polynomial approximation
3. **Phase 3**: Added stability controls (modulation clamping, output clamping) to prevent amplitude spikes
4. **Phase 4**: Upgraded to higher-order polynomial `sin(x) ‚âà x - x¬≥/6 + x‚Åµ/120` for better accuracy

**Final Result**: Both FM voices working correctly with smooth, musical tones resembling Logic Pro FM presets
- **Individual test**: `fm_debug_test` produces clear FM synthesis audio
- **Segment test**: Both bass and mid FM voices audible with proper envelopes and frequencies
- **Sound quality**: Much improved from initial "saw like" sound to proper FM bell/bass tones

## Current Status

**Working ASM Voices**: ‚úÖ kick, ‚úÖ snare, ‚úÖ hat, ‚úÖ melody, ‚úÖ delay, ‚úÖ limiter, ‚úÖ **FM voices (mid_fm + bass_fm)**  
**Verified Combinations**: 
- ‚úÖ drums + melody + delay (all working together)
- ‚úÖ drums + melody + FM + limiter (sounds great without delay)
- ‚úÖ Complete all-ASM build with all voices functional

**Debugging Methodology Established**:
1. Test individual voices in isolation using `gen_custom` 
2. Compare C vs ASM implementations
3. Check for amplitude/level issues vs. complete silence
4. Fix ASM implementations one by one
5. Test combinations to identify mixing issues

## Completed This Session

1. ‚úÖ **Nuclear Refactor Completion**: Moved FM C implementation to `attic/fm_voice_full.c`, created minimal stub
2. ‚úÖ **FM ASM Implementation**: Full `sin(carrier + index * sin(modulator))` FM synthesis 
3. ‚úÖ **Upgraded Sine Approximation**: From linear sawtooth to higher-order polynomial `x - x¬≥/6 + x‚Åµ/120`
4. ‚úÖ **Stability Controls**: Added modulation clamping and output limiting to prevent amplitude spikes
5. ‚úÖ **All-ASM Audio Engine**: Complete working implementation with all voices functional

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Visual amplitude spikes**: Still present in waveform display but don't affect audio quality
2. **Delay interaction**: May need investigation if spikes are related to delay processing
3. **Fine-tuning**: Potential for further FM parameter optimization

## Tools Created

**Individual Voice Tests**:
- `gen_kick_single` ‚Üí `kick_single.wav`
- `gen_hat_single` ‚Üí `hat_single.wav`  
- `gen_snare_single` ‚Üí `snare_single.wav`

**Flexible Testing**:
- `gen_custom <voice1> [voice2]...` ‚Üí `custom_test.wav`

**Full Arrangement Testing**:
- `segment_test <category1> [category2]... [seed]` ‚Üí `segment_test_<seed>.wav`
- Supports: drums, melody, fm, delay, limiter categories
- Examples: `./bin/segment_test drums melody delay 0x12345`

**Debug Tools**:
- `melody_debug_test` ‚Üí isolated melody ASM testing
- `fm_debug_test` ‚Üí isolated FM ASM testing

## Major Accomplishments

‚úÖ **Nuclear Refactor Success**: Eliminated C fallback deception with `NO_C_VOICES=1` flag  
‚úÖ **Systematic Debugging**: Created isolated testing tools for individual voice debugging  
‚úÖ **Core ASM Voices Working**: Drums (kick/snare/hat) + melody + delay all functional  
‚úÖ **Complex Combinations**: Verified drums+melody+delay works across multiple seeds

‚úÖ **FM ASM Complete**: Full dual-voice FM synthesis (mid_fm + bass_fm) with proper sine wave generation
‚úÖ **Complete All-ASM Audio Engine**: All voices now implemented in pure ARM64 assembly with no C fallbacks

## Final Status: SUCCESS! üéâ

The nuclear refactor successfully eliminated the C fallback deception and established a systematic approach to debugging individual ASM voice implementations. **We now have a complete, fully-functional all-ASM audio engine** with all voices working:
